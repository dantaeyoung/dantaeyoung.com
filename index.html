                I am an assemblage of:
                <ul>
                  <li>cooperatives / spaces / technologies</li>
                  <li>learnings / teachings / communities</li>
                  <li>systems / heuristics / practices</li>
                  <li>architecture / pedagogy / software</li>
                  <li>families / friends / societies / cultures</li>
                </ul>

                I am a learner, teacher, spatial designer, technologist, and sometimes artist, creating design tools, architectural spaces, and social collectives. I am interested in how our environments and relations change the way we think, feel, collaborate, and play together. I am especially excited about creating and maintaining inclusive and just spaces, organizations, and learning/working structures that are intentional about power, agency, and care.<br><br>
                
                I teach at Columbia University GSAPP, am a founding member of Prime Produce (an intentional community for social good), Soft Surplus (a space for , and the Cybernetics Library, an artist-run library focused on socio-technological systems.

        Things I am thinking about lately (as of 2018-02):
            <br><br>

                architecture - photographs + systems - image culture + open source - attention + infrastructure - 'expert'-ism + care - brand = ?<br><br>

                Intentional infrastructures. Infrastructure is something that is created with such intent and deliberation, with a dedication to resilence and longitude, that it allows others to create projects on top of it. Infrastructure is not very easily shared online, or through images, or through information. Infrastructure is not easily bragged about. Infrastructure moves at the speed of habit and knowledge, not at the speed of information and money. All play is playful because of someone else's infrastructure.<br><br>

                Attention is another name for a cognitive load imposed onto us by others; the yanking of a mental thread in an implicitly coercive fashion. Attention requires feeding, commitment, renewal, upkeep. <a href="http://bit.ly/2rM1Rfy">Attention loops dovetail with funding feedback loops.</a> Attention requires an audience. Questions: What practices allow us to give our attention deliberately? Who gives your attention back to you? What does an anti-attention practice look like?<br><br>
